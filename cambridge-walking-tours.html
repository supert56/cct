            If your group has more than 20 people we can identify additional
            guide/s, who will be funded per group. This ensures that our
            insurance cover is met and that visitors get the most from their
            tour.
          </p>
          <p>
            The number of people admitted to King's College is different: Up to
            20 per guide Oct - April. Up to 15 per guide May - Sept.
          </p>
          <p>
            The price for each tour does not include entry fees to charging
            colleges i.e. Trinity, Kings, Queens’, St John’s, Corpus Christi.
            Not every college has reopened to visitors since the pandemic and
            most are closed during the exam term in May/June. The colleges are
            private institutions that can close with little warning. If this is
            the case, an alternative will be sought.

            of Cambridge since before the first college was founded over 800
            years ago. All of them had, and continue to have, strong links with

          <h2>LIVES CUT SHORT</h2>
          <p>
            Cambridge experienced a devastating plague in the C14th and
            throughout the history of the City some lives have been cut short.
            Some of these people are now household names, some made significant
            contributions, others had their lives taken or they took their own.
            This tour will tell the stories of people across the centuries, not
            all sad, but most definitely interesting. Come with us to celebrate
            and acknowledge those who lived and worked in Cambridge, whose
            stories add to the fascinating history of the City. The tour
            includes a visit inside King's college and its magnificent Chapel
            (Entrance fee to King’s College applies).
