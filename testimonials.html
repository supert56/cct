          Pre-tour help and advice - absolutely excellent. The tours were tailored to our specific requirements with references to brutalism and changes over time. . Our two guides - again excellent and good on dates. Very willing to recommend Cambridge City Tours to others and also people were keen to come on another tour with you. We also liked the way you both settled to our pace so we didn't feel we were being rushed although we covered a lot of ground and information.

          My family from Australia all raved about the tour. We really like the fact that you placed us in good viewing positions and were able to explain things without having to refer to notes yourself. You also entertained the kids really well. My Dad and his friend are tricky people but you managed to answer all their questions.

          I feel ashamed that I worked for 10 years in Free School Lane and knew nothing at all about its origins. In fact it got me thinking about the history of Cambridge as a small market town rather than the University- eg the Leper Chapel, the workhouse in Mill road and the development of the railways and workers&#39; houses as well as the Corn Exchange, the Guildhall, old Addenbrokes etc. The stuff about the Eagle (including the ceiling) was fascinating.

          The tour was superb - very well paced in terms of time and information provided -certainly whetted my appetite for more of Cambridge - quite a triumph after 20 years of lethargy I&#39;d say. The cold didn&#39;t penetrate as much as it would have liked because the tour beat it into submission - really well done.

          Thanks a million for your interesting tour on Sunday afternoon. As I walked around Cambridge yesterday I found myself looking at things and appreciating them more; a little knowledge in this case was wonderful.

          I write to offer sincere thanks for the outstanding experience you engineered on behalf of my wife and I in our tour of various Cambridge colleges yesterday. Your comprehensive general knowledge of the history of the development of the University was very impressive, and gave real meaning to the visual feast to which we were exposed. Your very orderly approach was particularly beneficial, enabling us in just a few hours to gain a real perspective of major events which unfolded over a period of several centuries.I would specifically like to complement you on the relaxed manner of your presentation. To be able to incorporate humorous but meaningful asides into a detailed analysis is a very valuable gift. Furthermore your very obvious genuine enthusiasm for your subject was a great attribute which much enhanced our experience.

          We all thoroughly enjoyed the tour you planned for us. It was so interesting and we learnt so many historical and architectural facts from you that we would never have learnt on our own. We would never have appreciated the stories told in the beautiful stained glass windows without your guidance.  A memorable day thank you.  We are definitely coming back again!
