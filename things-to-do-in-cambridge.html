        University of Cambridge and Anglia Ruskin University. It is
        approximately 55 miles (88.5km) north of London, with good road and rail
        links, plus airports at Stansted and Cambridge. if your visit is just to
        the City, or gives you time to see other places of interest within a 20
        mile (32km) radius, you will not be disappointed. Here are just some
        ideas to help you plan your time in Cambridge.

          <h2>Eating Out in Cambridge</h2>
          <p>
            Walking around the town centre you will find many cafes and pubs
            serving drinks and food, with a wide variety of menus. Cambridge has
            two unique locations with a long tradition of hospitality:
            Fitzbillies cafés serving lunches, cakes and pastries – you must try
            a delicious Chelsea bun. The Eagle is an original C16th pub, serving
            food and drink throughout the day and is home to the world famous
            RAF bar. Restaurants are plentiful, so you will have lots of choice.

          <h2>Punting</h2>
          <p>
            If you only visit Cambridge once you will probably want to go
            punting. Punts are flat-bottom boats propelled by a pole, that were
            originally used for travelling across the shallow waters of the
            Cambridgeshire Fens, for catching eels or collecting reeds. There
            are now several companies in the town where you can hire a punt
            yourself or be taken in style on a chauffeur punt along the river
            Cam. The river gets very busy in the summer so the safe option, if
            you want to avoid falling in the river, is to take a chauffeur punt.

          <p>
            Cambridge is a great place for shopping with both High Street and
            independent shops, as well as a Town Centre market selling fresh
            produce, local crafts, second hand books and quirky items. Head for
            the Grand Arcade in the town centre, or for the Grafton Centre
            within 15 minutes walking distance. Don’t miss out on the
            independent stores in cobbled side streets.

          <p>
            As you might expect, Cambridge has a good range of accommodation
            catering for all budgets. You can find elegant hotels, Airbnb rooms,
            guest houses, youth hostels. You can choose a B&B stay at a
            Cambridge college, when the University students are away. So check
            individual college websites for availability.

            addition to several independent museums e.g. the museum of
            Technology and the Museum of Cambridge. The Fitzwilliam Museum holds
            one of the finest collections of art and antiquities outside London.
            A Google search of ‘Museums in Cambridge’ will give a full list,
            many of which have events throughout the year.

            and second hand. Near the Market Square is the Cambridge University
            Press Bookshop which has been meeting the needs of students,
            academics and avid readers since it was founded by King Henry VIII
            in 1534. Cambridge University Press is the oldest university press
            in the world, the publishing business of the University of Cambridge
            and also the Queen's Printer. You will find antiquarian and second

            centrally located Corn Exchange brings entertainers and musicians
            from around the world into the city. The Cambridge Junction is a
            venue with a wide programme of comedy, music, poetry, theatre and
            dance, well worth a look. The Cambridge Arts Theatre has a full

            are used for festivals throughout the year: on Midsummer Common you
            can visit the Strawberry Fair in June or see the Firework
            celebrations in November. There is an annual Beer Festival on Jesus
            Green, and a Summer Fair on Parker’s Piece. Or you can just sit
            along the river bank while the University rowing races, known as the
            Bumps, are taking place.

            collection. Planting began on the 16 hectare (40 acres) site in the
            middle of the 1830s and now holds a collection of more than 8,000
            plant species. The Garden is open all year, allowing you to see
            plants that grow in every season. A programme of events throughout

          <p>
            Tranquil Grantchester is a quintessentially English village, less
            than 3 miles (5 km) from Cambridge town centre. You can walk along
            the river Cam to find picturesque thatched cottages, the medieval
            Grantchester church, and several pubs. It is well-known for the
            Orchard Tea Garden, frequented by the Bloomsbury Group of associated
            English writers, intellectuals, philosophers and artists in the
            first half of the 20th century, including Virginia Woolf, John
            Maynard Keynes, E. M. Forster and Lytton Strachey. Further upstream,
            Byron’s Pool is a popular spot for swimmers. If you have watched the
            Grantchester detective drama series on television why not visit the
            real thing.

          <h2>Imperial War Museum at Duxford</h2>
          <p>
            Visit Britain's largest aviation museum, based on the historic
            Duxford Aerodrome, just 10 miles (16 km) south of Cambridge. During
            the Second World War Duxford played a prominent role during the
            Battle of Britain and was later used by United States Army Air
            Forces fighter units in support of the daylight bombing of Germany.
            The site contains historically important buildings, aircraft and
            other machinery, as well as the American Air Museum. Duxford remains
            a working airfield and holds regular air shows throughout the year.

          <h2>Ely Cathedral</h2>
          <p>
            Ely Cathedral is 17 miles (27 km) north of Cambridge in the town of
            Ely. The building dates from 1083 and was given cathedral status in
            1109. Towering over the region, Ely Cathedral is known as the ‘Ship
            of the Fens’. Inside the cathedral you can visit the Stained Glass
            museum, which holds exquisite examples of ancient and modern glass.
            A short distance from the Cathedral is the home of Oliver Cromwell,
            an alumnus of Sidney Sussex college in Cambridge. At the end of the
            Civil War he ruled the British Isles as Lord Protector from 1653
            until his death in 1658. His family home has been restored to show
            how it would have looked in the 17th century.
